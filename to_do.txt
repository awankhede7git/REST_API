THIS IS MY FIRST REST API<3

Made solely for the purpose of Arya's understanding!

index.js - this runs the rest api without the use of mongoose, using only express library.

index2.js - this runs the rest api using mongoose, and compares the two methods, with the other method commented out.

Use postman for testing the http methods y'all!

byeeee
